  "title": "Agentic Programming",
  "description": "Agentic programming shifts software from rigid scripts to autonomous systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines to achieve high-level goals. The core architecture centers on an iterative loop of Planning (decomposing tasks), Action (using tools via the Model Context Protocol), and Observation (evaluating results). It leverages Prompt Engineering—specifically techniques like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct—to guide the model’s logic, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides the necessary external knowledge and long-term memory. By orchestrating these components through frameworks like LangGraph or CrewAI, developers build self-correcting workflows where specialized agents collaborate, execute code, and refine their own outputs until a target objective is met.",
